# 2021 Hackathon Project

![example of our application](https://github.com/AverageHomosapien/2021-Hackathon/blob/main/example.gif)

## Introduction:
We designed a website to allow people to connect during lockdown periods. People select hobbies they want to follow, and then connect with and encourage other people doing those hobbies, while giving and receiving feedback.

## To Run:
You need Node.js and npm to run the application.

* [Get React js on windows](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows)
* [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

After downloading node:

npm install 
npm start
```
